### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a <b>full-stack developer</b> — which is just a fancy way of saying  
I've discovered a method to break and fix <i>every</i> layer of an application haha.

> 💡 <b>My Philosophy:</b>  
> “If it works, don’t touch it.  
> If it doesn’t work... it’s probably a caching issue (seriously dislike Redux lol).”

## 💥 What I'm Currently Juggling (and/or Dropping)

I’m deep-diving into some seriously cool (and occasionally cursed) tech.  
My brain is currently **50% Dr Pepper, 50% documentation tabs**.

| Stack | Description |
|:--|:--|
| 🧠 **PyTorch** | Training neural networks to do important things, like predicting if I’ll order pizza again tonight. <br>*(Spoiler: accuracy = 1.0)* |
| 💻 **Next.js** | Building sites so fast they almost load before I finish writing the code. <br>*(SSR, SSG, ISR... I just want a `<blink>` tag.)* |
| 📱 **Expo** | The only thing keeping me sane while building mobile apps. <br>*If you see me writing native Swift (especially Objective-C++) or Kotlin, please send help or maybe a donut.* |
| 🔥 **FastAPI + Uvicorn** | Serving data at speeds that should be illegal. <br>*`async def` is my new favorite incantation.* |

## 🧩 The Skill Tree of Questionable Decisions

I’ve collected a few programming languages over the years.  
Some were good decisions. Others... were **Monkey C**.

| 🗣️ Language | 💬 My Honest Opinion |
|:-------------|:--------------------|
| 🐍 **Python** | My one true love. The glue that holds my life and scripts together. |
| 🧠 **TypeScript** | JavaScript, but with a helmet and knee pads. |
| 💎 **Ruby** | Writing it feels like the 1990s. Reading someone else’s feels like abstract algebra. |
| ☕ **Kotlin** | What Java dreams of being when it grows up. Smooth, efficient, and null-safe-ish. |
| 🎮 **C#** | My “I’m a serious game developer, I swear” hat. (I’ve made 3 cubes jump.) |
| 👁️‍🗨️ **Objective-C++** | I’ve seen things... terrible things... `[initWithThatThing:andThisOtherThing:]`. The `@` symbol still haunts me. |
| ⌚ **Monkey C** | Yes, I can write an app for your watch. No, I don’t know why I learned this. It’s for Garmin devices. Please send help, or a Garmin haha. |
| 🌀 **and other various languages...** | Some better left forgotten, some I might actually use again who knows. |

## 🎯 Current Quest Log

My to-do list is less of a "list" and more of a "suggestion scroll."

- [x] Drink an alarming amount of Dr Pepper  
- [ ] Figure out why my PyTorch models think a cat is a hotdog  
- [ ] Find a second real-world use for Monkey C  
- [ ] Touch grass 🌱
